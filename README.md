# Scaffold Agent

A collection of example implementations showcasing how to build autonomous DeFi agents using Console Kit. This repository demonstrates integration patterns ranging from LLM-powered execution to automated DeFi workflows.

## Purpose

This scaffold serves as a starting point for developers looking to build autonomous DeFi agents. Whether you're interested in LLM-powered automation or traditional programmatic workflows, these examples provide patterns for integrating Console Kit's capabilities into your applications.

## Overview

The repository contains two core components:

### Agent Server

A LangChain-based implementation showing how to create LLM agents that can execute DeFi operations through Console Kit. The server integrates Console Kit's native tools (cross-chain bridges, swap routing, token transfers etc.) into a LangChain executor, enabling natural language driven DeFi automation.

### Kernel Workflow

Example implementations of automated DeFi workflows using Console Kit's infrastructure. These examples demonstrate how to set up autonomous agents that can execute complex DeFi strategies while leveraging Console's policy engine and execution framework.

## Local setup

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd agent-server && yarn
```

```bash
cd kernel-workflow && yarn
```

2. Set up environment variables and fill all values

```bash
mv .env.example .env
```

## Running components

### Agent Server

1. Run from root dir to spin up the LLM agent server

```bash
make run-server
```

2. All the agent's tools can be found [here](agent-server/src/tools), and any new tools can be configured.

3. To stream out responses from the server

```bash
curl -N --connect-timeout 10 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"messageReq":<your-message>,
"userId":<any-uuid>}' \
  'http://localhost:<your-port>/v1/chat'
```

### Kernel Workflow

1. To register your executor on console & kernel -

   - Configure `ExecutorConfigConsole`, `ExecutorMetadata`, and `ExecutorConfigKernel` on [register-executor.ts](./kernel-workflow/src/register-executor.ts) as per your requirements
   - Run from root dir:

   ```
   make run-register-executor
   ```

   - Pick up `registryId` from the script's response and update `EXECUTOR_REGISTRY_ID` in your .env, for running the remaining scripts

2. To deploy a console account that is subscribed to the automation of the executor just registered -
   - Configure `AutomationSubscriptionParams` on [deploy-automation-account.ts](kernel-workflow/src/deploy-automation-account.ts) as per your requirements
   - Run from root dir:
   ```
   make run-deploy-account
   ```
3. To run your automation workflow -
   - Modify `pollTasksAndSubmit()` on [agent-workflow.ts](kernel-workflow/src/agent-workflow.ts) with your automation logic. Console Kit SDK comes pre-built with native actions & helpers to make this easier
   - Run from root dir:
   ```
   make run-agent-workflow
   ```
   This will poll for your executable tasks, and run your automation periodically
